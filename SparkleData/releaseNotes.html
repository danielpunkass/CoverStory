<h3><a name="version-4.0">Version 4.0</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div class="title">Sparkle Integration</div>
        We now should be autoupdating with Sparkle.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="title">Export To HTML</div>
        You can now export your data out to HTML, using the "Export To HTML"
        command from the File menu. The HTML is quite customisable by supplying
        your own coverstory.css file, and coverstory.js files.
    </li>
    <li>
       <div class="title">AppleScript</div>
       We have added comprehensive AppleScript support that should allow you
       to easily extract any coverage information you want out of CoverStory.
       Using AppleScript it is easy to create an Xcode build step that will take
       your gcov files and generate HTML to post to a website, or to keep track
       of coverage from build to build. Take a look at our AppleScript
       dictionary for complete details.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="title">Removed Code Complexity</div>
        We removed the code complexity feature as it seemed to be muddying up
        the interface, and wasn't being used very much.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="title">Added Toolbar</div>
        We added a pretty toolbar. What more can we say?
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="title">Warns About Non-feasible Markers on Executed Lines</div>
        You now get warnings if you execute lines that you have marked as
        non-feasible. If you marked them as non-feasible, we assume you didn't
        expect them to be executed.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="title">Fixed Up Document vs. Application Preferences</div>
        Several preferences that were previously application wide are now
        document settings as they should be.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="title">Many bug fixes</div>
        Many other little bug fixes and features have been added.
    </li>
