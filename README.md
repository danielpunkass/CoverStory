Cover Story
===============

An OS X GUI for working with code coverage data files generated by gcov.

History
===========

Originally developed by [Dave MacLachlan](mailto:dmaclach@gmail.com "Dave MacLachlan's email address") at [Google](http://code.google.com/p/coverstory/).
 

Build It
========

Check out the repository and run the following commands to prepare the submodule dependencies:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Build and run the app from Xcode.

Use It
=====

The product you want to examine for coverage must be built with settings enabled that cause the compiler to generate build-time and run-time coverage data files. These are generated by default in the same directory as your .o object files, and have .gcda and .gcno extensions. These files can be opened directly by Cover Story.

For example, if your product is build with .xcconfig configuration files, you can enable profiling with gcov by adding the following lines to your .xcconfig file:

```
GCC_INSTRUMENT_PROGRAM_FLOW_ARCS = YES
GCC_GENERATE_TEST_COVERAGE_FILES = YES
```

Enjoy!
